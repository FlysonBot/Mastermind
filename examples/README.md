# Examples

## Running Locally: One-click Install

In this directory, there is an `install.bat` and `install.sh` file. These files will install the required dependencies and run the program, including python 3.10.12 (or higher), pip, and mastermind-ai.

- If you're using an windows machine, download and double click to run `install.bat`.
- Otherwise, download and run `install.sh` in your terminal by:

    ```bash
    cd [path]
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    ```

    Replace `[path]` with the path to the directory containing `install.sh`, or ignore it if you already opened your terminal in the directory.

## Running Remotely: Google Colab

- Open [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FlysonBot/Mastermind/blob/main/examples/mastermind_in_colab.ipynb) to open the program in Google Colab.
